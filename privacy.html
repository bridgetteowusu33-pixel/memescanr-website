  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> is built with privacy as a core principle.
    We believe your personal photos and data should remain fully under your control. MemeScanr retains only the data necessary to provide scanning and Vault features. You can clear any data stored by MemeScanr by using the in-app settings “Clear Scan Results” or by uninstalling the app. Uninstalling the app or clearing data will remove references and any Vault stored items from the app’s local storage only.
  </p>

  <h2>What Data <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> Accesses</h2>
  <p class="description">
    Photo access is used only to scan images in your local photo library.
    All scanning and analysis happens on your device.
    No photos are uploaded to external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>What Data <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> Does NOT Collect</h2>
  <p class="description">• No personal identity information</p>
  <p class="description">• No location data</p>
  <p class="description">• No contacts, messages, or browsing history</p>
  <p class="description">• No advertising or tracking identifiers</p>

  <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> performs all image analysis directly on
    your device. This ensures faster performance and protects your privacy.
    Your photos never leave your phone.
  </p>

  <h2>Vault and On-Device Storage</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>'s Vault  is a private on-device space where you can choose to move photos and videos you don't want visible in your gallery. When you move an item to Vault:

• The item is removed from your Photos gallery.
• A copy of the item is stored only on your device in the app’s private storage.
• MemeScanr does not upload, sync, or share these items with any cloud services or third parties.
• You can restore items from Vault back to your Photos gallery at any time.
• Deleting an item from Vault permanently removes it from your device; this action cannot be undone.

Vault items remain on your device until you choose to restore or delete them. MemeScanr does not have access to Vault items once they are stored locally, and we do not collect these items or any associated data.
  </p>

   <h2>Information Stored by the App</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr may create and store references and metadata on your device to perform scan operations efficiently. This includes lightweight information such as asset identifiers, timestamps, and categorization for memes, duplicates, and Vault content. This information is stored only on your device and never uploaded, shared, or backed up externally unless you explicitly choose to do so (e.g., via a share action).
  </p>


  <h2>Email & Waitlist (Optional)</h2>
  <p class="description">
    If you voluntarily join the <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> waitlist,
    we collect your email address solely to notify you about launch updates.
    We do not sell or share email addresses, and they are never used for advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostics & App Stability</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> may collect anonymous diagnostic
    information, such as crash reports, to improve app stability and performance.
    This data does not include photos or personal content.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not use advertising SDKs,
    data brokers, or tracking services.
    Limited third-party services may be used solely for app stability and diagnostics.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not knowingly collect personal data
    from children under the age of 13.
    If you believe data has been submitted in error, please contact us and we will
    promptly delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Photos Permissions Explanation</h2>
  <p class="description">
    To scan media in your photo library, MemeScanr requires access to your Photos. This access is used solely to analyze and present detected clutter. MemeScanr does not transmit photos or metadata off your device, and no photo content is ever stored or shared outside the scanning process and any local Vault storage you choose to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p class="description">
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements.
    Any changes will be posted on this page. 
  </p>
