    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">Your photos stay yours. Always.</p>
    <p class="page-meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>
  </header>

  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> is designed to help you review and clean up your library
    while keeping your content under your control. <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not operate a cloud
    photo-scanning service, and we do not automatically upload your photos or videos to our servers for scanning.
  </p>

  <h2>1) Summary (Plain English)</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <ul>
      <li>Scanning happens on your device.</li>
      <li><span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically upload your photos, videos, contacts, or scan results to our servers.</li>
      <li>You can choose to share/export content using iOS sharing tools (that’s user-initiated).</li>
      <li>Backroom stores items in the app’s private on-device storage so they don’t appear in your Photos library.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>2) What Data <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> Accesses (On Your Device)</h2>

  <h3>Photos (required for core features)</h3>
  <p class="description">
    With Photos permission, <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> can read media from your Photos library to scan for
    duplicates/clutter and to show previews. During scanning, the app may read basic metadata such as asset identifiers,
    creation dates, media type, and file size.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    For certain on-device heuristics, the app may check whether a photo/video contains an embedded location tag
    (for example, whether location metadata is present). <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not request or track
    your live GPS location for scanning.
  </p>

  <h3>Contacts (optional)</h3>
  <p class="description">
    If you enable the Contacts cleanup feature and grant Contacts permission,
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> scans your address book on-device to identify potential duplicates and help you review/merge them.
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically upload your contacts to our servers.
  </p>

  <h3>Face ID / Device Authentication (optional)</h3>
  <p class="description">
    If you enable Backroom locking, <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> may use Face ID / Touch ID (via iOS Local Authentication)
    to unlock Backroom. Biometric data is handled by iOS; <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not receive or store your biometric data.
  </p>

  <h3>Notifications (optional)</h3>
  <p class="description">
    If you enable reminders, <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> may send local notifications. Notification content is generated on-device.
  </p>

  <h2>3) On-Device Processing (No Cloud Scanning)</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> performs scanning and analysis on your device. This may use on-device machine learning and Apple system frameworks
    to classify images/videos and detect patterns. Your media content is not automatically uploaded to our servers for this processing.
  </p>

  <h2>4) What <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> Stores</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> stores certain data locally on your device to make the app work, such as:
  </p>
  <div class="description">
    <ul>
      <li>Scan results and lightweight metadata (e.g., identifiers, timestamps, categories/flags, scan state).</li>
      <li>Backroom items you choose to move into Backroom (stored in the app’s private storage).</li>
      <li>App settings and preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="description">
    You can clear scan results and local references using in-app settings (for example, “Clear Scan Results”).
    Uninstalling the app removes app-local data stored in the app container.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Backroom (On-Device Private Storage)</h2>
  <p class="description">
    Backroom is an on-device space for items you choose to move out of your Photos library.
    When you move an item to Backroom:
  </p>
  <div class="description">
    <ul>
      <li>The app attempts to remove the item from your Photos library so it no longer appears there.</li>
      <li>A copy is stored in the app’s private storage on your device.</li>
      <li>You can view, restore, or delete Backroom items inside <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically upload or sync Backroom items to our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>6) When Data Can Leave the App</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically transmit your photo library or scan content to our servers.
    Data can leave the app only in user-initiated cases such as:
  </p>
  <div class="description">
    <ul>
      <li>You share/export selected items via iOS sharing tools (Share Sheet).</li>
      <li>You open external links (e.g., FAQ/Terms/Support) in your browser.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>7) iCloud / Device Backups (Important)</h2>
  <p class="description">
    iOS may back up some app data to iCloud as part of your device backup settings. This is controlled by Apple and your iOS settings,
    not by <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>. If you want Backroom items to remain only on your device and not in iCloud backups,
    review your iOS backup settings for <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not use advertising SDKs, data brokers, or tracking services.
    Some platform services may be involved when you use certain features (for example: Apple device backups, App Store review prompts,
    or system crash reporting), but <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically send your photo library contents to third-party servers for scanning.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Website Waitlist (Optional)</h2>
  <p class="description">
    If you choose to join the <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> waitlist on our website, we collect the email address you provide to notify you about launch updates.
    We do not sell email addresses and we don’t use them for advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p class="description">
    <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    If you believe data has been submitted in error, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Policy Updates</h2>
  <p class="description">
    We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Contact</h2>
