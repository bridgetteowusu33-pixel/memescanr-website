      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">Clear answers, no mystery switches.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>📸 Does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> upload my photos?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does <strong>not</strong> automatically upload your photo library for scanning.
      Scanning runs on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photos or videos only leave the app if you choose to share/export them using iOS sharing tools (Share Sheet),
      or if you open external links (like Support or Terms) in your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 How does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> detect memes and clutter?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> uses on-device analysis to recognize patterns common in memes and clutter —
      things like text overlays, screenshot-style layouts, and duplicate-like similarity signals.
    </p>

    <h2>🧹 Will it delete photos automatically?</h2>
    <p>Never without your permission.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> shows you what it finds and you decide what to delete, move, or keep.
    </p>

    <h2>😬 What if it marks something wrong?</h2>
    <p>You’re always in control.</p>
    <p>
      If <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> flags something incorrectly, deselect it before taking any action.
    </p>

    <h2>📱 Does it work on videos?</h2>
    <p>
      Some features support videos (for example, Backroom can include videos). Feature coverage can vary by file type and device performance.
    </p>

    <h2>🍎 Is this “App Store approved”?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> is built with Apple’s guidelines in mind. During development, it may be distributed via TestFlight.
      App Store availability depends on Apple’s review process and rollout timing.
    </p>

    <h2>🧪 What’s the difference between Waitlist and TestFlight?</h2>
    <p><strong>Waitlist:</strong> A way to request access/updates as we roll out.</p>
    <p><strong>TestFlight:</strong> Early builds for testing that may change frequently.</p>

    <h2>💰 Is <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> free?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> offers a free experience and may include optional paid features.
      Any pricing is shown clearly in-app, and you won’t be charged without confirmation.
    </p>

    <h2>🛡️ Do you sell my data or track me?</h2>
    <p>
      No. <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not sell your data and does not use advertising trackers.
    </p>

    <h2>📇 Does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> access my contacts?</h2>
    <p>
      Only if you enable the Contacts cleanup feature and grant Contacts permission. Contacts cleanup runs on-device.
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 What is Backroom and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Backroom is a private on-device space inside <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> for items you choose to move out of your Photos library.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you move something to Backroom, the app stores it in the app’s private storage. The app may also attempt to remove the original from Photos
      (depending on your permissions and whether iOS allows the operation).
    </p>

    <h2>☁️ Is Backroom cloud storage?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Backroom is stored in the app’s private on-device storage. <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not operate a cloud sync for Backroom.
    </p>

    <h2>📦 Can Backroom be included in iCloud / device backups?</h2>
    <p>
      iOS may back up some app data depending on your device settings. If you want Backroom items to remain only on your device,
      review your iOS backup settings for <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>↩️ Can I restore items from Backroom later?</h2>
    <p>Yes. You can restore Backroom items back to Photos at any time (when supported by iOS permissions).</p>

    <h2>⚠️ What happens if I delete something from Backroom?</h2>
    <p>
      Deleting an item from Backroom permanently removes the Backroom copy stored in the app.
      This action can’t be undone.
    </p>

    <h2>🔑 How is Backroom protected?</h2>
    <p>
      Backroom can be locked using Face ID / Touch ID (with iOS passcode fallback depending on your device and settings).
    </p>

    <h2>📦 Will Backroom affect my phone’s storage?</h2>
    <p>
      Backroom items are stored locally in the app, so storage usage depends on what you move into Backroom.
      If you uninstall <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span>, app-local Backroom storage is removed from the device.
    </p>
