      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">Because yes, everyone asks these 😌</p>
    </div>

    <h2>📸 Does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> upload my photos?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does <strong>not</strong> automatically upload your photo library for scanning.
      Scanning runs on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photos or videos only leave the app if you choose to share/export them using iOS sharing tools (Share Sheet),
      or if you open external links (like Support/Terms) in your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 How does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> detect memes and clutter?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> uses on-device analysis to recognize patterns common in memes and clutter —
      like text overlays, screenshot-style layouts, and duplicate-like similarity signals.
    </p>

    <h2>🧹 Will it delete photos automatically?</h2>
    <p>Never without your permission.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> shows you what it finds and lets <strong>you</strong> decide what to delete,
      move, or keep.
    </p>

    <h2>🧩 What is <span class="brand-tm">Similar</span>?</h2>
    <p>
      Similar groups look-alike photos so you can quickly compare and keep the best ones.
      Grouping happens on-device, and you stay in control of what gets deleted or kept.
    </p>

    <h2>⚡ What is Optimize (Boost)?</h2>
    <p>
      Optimize (Boost) is a <strong>Premium-only</strong> feature that can help you save space by creating an optimized copy
      of selected videos on your device (for example converting to HEVC).
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s designed to prioritize “looks the same” over aggressive compression. If the app can’t make a quality-safe result,
      it will skip that video.
    </p>

    <h2>🔒 Does Optimize upload my videos?</h2>
    <p>
      No. Optimize runs on your device. <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not automatically upload your videos for optimization.
    </p>

    <h2>🗂️ What does “Replace Original” mean? Can I keep both?</h2>
    <p><strong>Replace Original:</strong> saves the optimized version and then tries to remove the original so you actually free storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Keep Both:</strong> saves the optimized copy but keeps the original too.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> doesn’t delete anything without asking. If iOS can’t remove the original for any reason,
      the app keeps both.
    </p>

    <h2>📇 Does <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> access my contacts?</h2>
    <p>
      Only if you enable Contacts cleanup and grant Contacts permission.
      Contacts cleanup runs on-device to help you review and merge potential duplicates.
    </p>

    <h2>🔐 What is Backroom and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Backroom is a private space inside <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> for photos and videos you don’t want visible in your gallery.
      Backroom items are stored on your device in the app’s private storage.
    </p>

    <h2>☁️ Is Backroom cloud storage?</h2>
    <p>
      No. <span class="brand-tm">MemeScanr</span> does not operate a cloud sync for Backroom.
      Depending on your iOS backup settings, some app data may be included in device backups.
    </p>

    <h2>📩 I still have questions</h2>
    <p>Totally fair.</p>
